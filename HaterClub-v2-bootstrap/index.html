                    <p>Such a hate wrangler , really gets the juices flowing, the thought that someone living on a cloud invented the world in 7 days and will punish you if you masturbate really gets our blood
                    pressure up or a person dying because of a refused transplant by a relative that thinks you will need you new liver in your life as a cockroach of a shovel, nothing else gets us started like such deluded ideas that morons insist upon us. <br><strong>Though whom saith shall be hated such is the will of the club</strong></p>

                    Hard to put into words, a unique combination of idiocy, hypocrisy and bad taste all rolled up into one proud, loud, moronic, disgusting, infatuated, living bag of wasted cells that pollutes the normal and spurs feeling so dark that not even the oceans deepest hidden hole has. Guess these words would work...   </p>
